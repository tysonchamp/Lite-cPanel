## What is Lite cPanel?

**Lite cPanel** is a self-hosted, open-source server management panel built on Python (Flask). It is designed for developers and system administrators who need a simple, fast, and dependency-light alternative to heavy commercial control panels like cPanel/WHM or Plesk.

It bundles a full automated LAMP/LEMP stack installer alongside a browser-based management interface — all in a single deployable unit.

## Supported Operating Systems

| OS | Version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Ubuntu** | 20.04 LTS (Focal) | ✅ Fully Supported |
| **Ubuntu** | 22.04 LTS (Jammy) | ✅ Fully Supported |
| **Ubuntu** | 24.04 LTS (Noble) | ✅ Fully Supported |
| **Debian** | 11 (Bullseye) | ⚠️ Mostly Compatible |
| **Debian** | 12 (Bookworm) | ⚠️ Mostly Compatible |
| Other Linux | Any | ❌ Not Tested |

> **Note:** The automated stack installer (`install.sh`) is written specifically for Ubuntu/Debian `apt`-based systems. The panel itself (Flask app) will run on any Linux distribution with Python 3.10+ (tested on Python 3.10 through 3.13+).

---

## Stack Options

The automated installer supports three web stack configurations:

| Stack | Web Server | PHP | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LAMP** | Apache 2 | `mod_php` | Classic shared hosting setup |
| **LEMP** | Nginx | PHP-FPM | High-performance modern sites |
| **Hybrid** | Nginx (port 80) + Apache (port 8080) | PHP-FPM | Best of both — Nginx as proxy, Apache for `.htaccess` compatibility |

All stacks include **MariaDB**, **phpMyAdmin**, and optional **MongoDB**.

---

## Installation

### Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+
- Root or `sudo` access
- Internet connection
- Git

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tysonchamp/Lite-cPanel.git
cd Lite-cPanel
```

### Step 2 — Run the stack installer

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Prompt you to choose your preferred web stack (LAMP / LEMP / Hybrid)
2. Install all required packages non-interactively
3. Configure Apache and/or Nginx with a default virtual host
4. Set up MariaDB with a secure root password
5. Install phpMyAdmin with auto-generated credentials
6. Deploy and start the Lite cPanel panel as a system service on port **2083**

### Step 3 — Access the panel

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://<your-server-ip>:2083
```

Log in with any **Linux system user** account on that server (e.g. your SSH username/password).

---

## Manual Panel Setup (without the stack installer)

If you already have a web stack and just want the panel:

```bash
cd cpanel
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set a persistent secret key (recommended)
echo "FLASK_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > app/.env

# Run with Gunicorn (production)
gunicorn --worker-class gthread --threads 10 --timeout 3600 --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:2083 app.cpanel:app

# Or for development only
python3 app/cpanel.py
```
